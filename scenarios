1. Happy path:
    Use 3 user names and 'pwd' password to log in
        personalized welcome messsage diplayed, log out button avilable, user name and password are still in inputs
    log out
        user logged out message displayed, log in button available, verify inputs are empty (default)
    special characters and a very long string as a user name
2. False tests
    Both fields are empty
        failed to log in message displayed, log in button is available, verify inputs are empty (default)
    Use user name without password
        failed to log in message displayed, log in button is available, verify inputs are empty (default)
    Use password without user name
        failed to log in message displayed, log in button is available, verify inputs are empty (default)
    use user name with wrong password
        special characters and a very long string as a user name
        failed to log in message displayed, log in button is available, verify inputs are empty (default)
3. Security
    SQL injection - try to provide sql command in fields to break database - there is no backend so not need to be done
4. Performance
    1. Loading time (below 400 ms - dependent on requirements)
